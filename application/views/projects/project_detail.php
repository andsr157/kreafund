            Why Burma…Why now?

            It's the WINTER of 2023, and it certainly is NOT a good time to be hanging out in
            Burma. My name is
            Charlie Costello, and after six years, I am finally close to completing the book,
            Hanging Out in Burma: Laundry Lines and Democracy Hanging in the Balance.
            Just before my first visit in December 2011, the military began loosening its grip
            on the country. But when I
            arrived it still felt as if Big Brother was watching, that the authoritarian
            regime's
            oppressive rule still
            prevailed.

            This incredible country, the people and their cultural traditions and wisdom,
            the colors, the biodiversity,
            a country with so much to save - was calling out to me to Hang Out in Burma.Your
            support will help me complete the book and shine a light on BURMA amidst all of
            the things happening in
            the world.

            Balloons over Bagan, December 2011



            Burma is a country rich in mind, body, and soul, but sadly, a land that has been
            held hostage by its
            own military government. I want this project to tell my story, as I walk you
            through photos compiled over
            three trips, that will shine a light on the beauty, heart, and soul of the
            country and its people.

            Your support will pay homage to the strength and beauty of the people and
            their country and their quest for
            freedom that continues to this day.

            In November 2015, a national election was held and the National League
            for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide.
            Later the following year, the winning party had a chance to appoint the
            president and key members of the
            government. I wasn't sure if it was real, so I traveled to Burma in
            February of 2016 to see for myself,
            with my feet on the ground, whether or not this election was for real.
            It seemed real. . .

            Fast forward five tumultuous years when another national election was
            held, and the NLD again,
            won in a landslide.
            Combine that with a world-wide pandemic and you have the unthinkable
            scenario. But the unthinkable
            happened, when,
            on February 1, 2021, a military coup d'etat was carried out under
            the premise of vote irregularity.
            More than two
            years have passed since that brutal military coup occurred and
            it's time to shine a light on the beauty,
            biodiversity, and people of this country.

            This photograph was taken in February of 2014 in a village outside
            of Kalaw in the Shan State, after a
            festival when young boys become monks. As I walked through a neighboring
            village, I was struck by boys playing
            with guns, and the ease with which even a very young child carried what
            appeared to be a real gun judging by its
            weight, as if it were an extension of his arm. The future is unknown in
            Burma and around the world, and the hope
            is for a more mindful awareness of the despair and needless suffering,
            where compassion, gratitude and loving
            kindness rule the lands.

            This photo is also shown on page 108 of the book, the parting shot (pun
            intended) and the last page of the
            book for a reason. 108 is considered sacred in Hinduism, Buddhism, and
            Yogic traditions. Malas or Japa beads
            come in a string of 108 and are used for devotional meditation, mantra,

            Why Kickstarter?
            <img src="img/p2.jpg" class="img-thumbnail rounded-0 border-0" alt="">

            Short Answer: Because of the partnership with Blurb I chose to work
            with Kickstarter in order to raise money to
            self-publish this book. Self-publishing is not for everyone, but it
            gives authors, writers, and photographers a
            chance to get their work out into the world.

            Longer Answer: Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing fundraising platform,
            meaning that if you don't reach the
            initial
            fundraising goal by the end of your campaign, then the project does not
            get funded. I am not sure I would
            meet the
            requirements to get enough pre-orders in order to print the three
            versions in bulk, so I will be doing the
            fulfillment myself once the book is finalized. It also gives me a chance
            to bring awareness in support of the
            movement for democracy.
            About me

            I am a writer, photographer, and regenerative farmer, with a strong
            interest in community building and
            re-invigorating the concepts of local and global villages. I spent
            most of my life in the San Francisco
            Bay Area and recently relocated to a small community in the MidCoast
            of Maine.

            I have lived and worked in Japan and Thailand and have traveled
            extensively throughout Southeast Asia.
            Hanging out in Burma: Laundry Lines and Democracy Hanging in the
            Balance is the culmination of three journeys
            to Burma which progressively deepened my appreciation of the beauty
            and warmth of its people and the plight
            of its democracy. My photographs have been exhibited at the Berkeley
            Art Center, the David Brower Center,
            and the Tides Foundation. I have a BA in English from Santa Clara
            University and an MA in Asian Studies
            from the University of San Francisco.

            Hanging Out in Burma: Laundry Lines and Democracy Hanging in the
            Balance, is a personal project that I
            have been working on for the past six years. Things just kept on
            changing in Burma after the 2015 election
            and as a result, the book project kept getting stalled. It's time
            to shine the light on Burma, on the people,
            the colors, the beauty, and a country with so much to save.
            Gratitudes

            Special thanks to Peter Coates, an artist, and painter from Great
            Britain, who suggested the title after he
            and his wife Gill welcomed me to share a boat ride up the Kaladan
            river to the ancient kingdom of Mrauk-U.
            I'd also like to thank the following individuals for their ongoing
            support of my travel to and writing about
            Burma. Firstly, Arlene Blum for introducing me to the beauty of the
            people, the colors, and the diversity of
            Burma, leading my first trip and trek into Inle Lake and beyond.

            I have a number of very special friends in Burma and I want to thank
            them all for their support, friendship,
            and insights. I'd also like to thank my academic supporters and
            friends, especially Professor Uldis Kruze for
            his ongoing friendship, support and work on behalf of Asia. Professor
            Judith White, for her work on behalf of
            many causes in Burma including support of my work along the way.
            Professor John Nelson, for his continued
            encouragement and support of my writing and photography. University
            of San Francisco's Center for the Pacific
            Rim's founding Director Barbara Bundy and the late Professor Patrick
            Hatcher supported me while studying in the
            program. Professor Chiho Sawada of Holy Names University for his
            support and friendship on behalf of my work and
            photography. Lastly, I'd like to thank my wife, Liz Cunningham for
            her unending support of my writing, photography
            and travels to Burma.x

            Quite unsurprisingly, the most foreseeable issue we may struggle with is the release date.
            While we optimistically set it to December 2024, we know from experience that a lot can go
            wrong overnight when you develop a video game. This media involves so many fields that it's
            hard to tell which one will cause trouble next!

            Additionally, we did not have a chance to delve too profoundly into the different console
            ports yet. Of course we shall do our best to release the game on as many systems and platforms
            as possible, but be wary that Liam_99 may not make it onto your favorite console!

            Long-lasting design

            All-in-one goal of the crowdfunding and core reward for the backers, the game should be playable for years. It's especially true as we propose the game DRM-free, which means PC players don't have to launch the game through platforms such as Steam or Epic Games.

            Regarding physical rewards:

            - We'll work with a local print shop to bring the paper posters to life. This shall allow us to check quality and minimize environmental costs linked to transport.

            - The T-shirts will be produced by a French company. We know from our own experience that they work with lasting materials.

            - The metallic posters will be handled by Displate. It's super sturdy, looks super cool, and the society works with communities in Africa to plant trees and improve the locals' quality of life.
